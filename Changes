Revision history for Perl extension Archive::ByteBoozer.

0.02  2013-01-05
    - updated "ByteBoozer" source code to version 1.1, which was published by
      David Malmborg on June the 14th, 2012
    - fixed "error: expected identifier before numeric constant", "error: two
      or more data types in declaration specifiers" and "error: expected ';',
      identifier or '(' before 'char'" compilation errors by replacing all
      occurrences of a newly defined "bool" type (first defined in "bb.h")
      with "boolean" label in the original source code right before packaging
      the actual release of this module, so that it now successfully compiles
      also on most non-Linux systems as well as for bleadperl

0.01  2012-04-07
    - initial version (provides Perl interface to David Malmborg's ByteBoozer,
      supports crunching Commodore data files using the compression algorithm
      implemented via ByteBoozer)
