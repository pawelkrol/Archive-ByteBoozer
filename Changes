Revision history for Perl extension Archive::ByteBoozer.

0.06  2013-06-15
    - introduced an additional "crunch" parameter named "relocate_output_up_to",
      allowing to relocate compressed data to the given end address (as opposite
      to the "relocate_output", which relocates data to the given start address)

0.05  2013-01-16
    - fixed "undefined symbol 'mXPUSHs'" compilation error for Perl 5.10.0 by
      removing "mXPUSHs()" macro from the XS code (according to perl5101delta
      "mXPUSHs()" macro for pushing SVs on the stack and mortalizing them has
      been introduced in Perl 5.10.1)

0.04  2013-01-13
    - fixed "error: two or more data types in declaration specifiers"
      compilation error on FreeBSD by reordering include directives in
      "cruncher.h" and "file.h" header files, and thus making sure that "bb.h"
      is always processed after "sys/types.h" header file (included by
      "sys/stat.h"), which on FreeBSD redefines a "uint" type without checking
      if the same type definition has already existed before

0.03  2013-01-08
    - fixed "error: expected identifier before numeric constant" compilation
      error by replacing all occurrences of "true" and "false" constants with
      "_true" and "_false" labels in the original source code right before
      packaging the actual release of this module, so that it now successfully
      compiles also Mac OS X (which, it turned out, has got those constants
      already predefined)

0.02  2013-01-05
    - updated "ByteBoozer" source code to version 1.1, which was published by
      David Malmborg on June the 14th, 2012
    - fixed "error: expected ';', identifier or '(' before 'char'" compilation
      error by replacing all occurrences of a newly defined "bool" type (first
      defined in "bb.h") with "_bool" label in the original source code right
      before packaging the actual release of this module, so that it now
      successfully compiles also on most non-Linux systems as well as for
      bleadperl

0.01  2012-04-07
    - initial version (provides Perl interface to David Malmborg's ByteBoozer,
      supports crunching Commodore data files using the compression algorithm
      implemented via ByteBoozer)
