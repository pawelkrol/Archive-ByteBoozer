Revision history for Perl extension Archive::ByteBoozer.

0.10  2018-11-26
    - For an unknown reason BSD-like systems export some "inline" functions
      into a target object file but leave symbols undefined, which results
      in a failure while loading a shared library: "ByteBoozer.so: undefined
      symbol 'outLen'". This is how it had manifested itself after compiling
      the package on an OpenBSD system:

      $ nm -g cruncher.o | grep outLen
                       U outLen

      In order to address the problem every "inline" function defined by the
      cruncher code has been explicitly declared as "static". Static functions
      leave no trace in a target object file allowing to successfully load
      a shared library.
    - fix XS interface compilation warnings, e.g. "pointer targets in passing
      argument 2 of 'Perl_newSVpv' differ in signedness"
    - fix XS interface compilation warnings, e.g. "warning: unused variable
      'RETVAL'" (when using a PPCODE section no manipulation of the RETVAL
      variable is required, the section may use direct stack manipulation to
      place output values on the stack)
    - commented out two params check tests failing due to Params::Validate's
      bug report RT#127811: "validate" crashes on a closed IO::Scalar object

0.09  2016-04-01
    - rebuilt a distribution package to include missing files "META.yml" and
      "META.json"

0.08  2016-01-09
    - make test suite pass for the latest version of Params::Validate (>= 1.21)

0.07  2013-09-21
    - switched IO::Capture to Capture::Tiny, which is able to correctly capture
      contents written into the standard output file handle
    - fixed two randomly failing unit-tests, removed one duplicate test case
    - fixed "Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry" warning during
      test suite execution

0.06  2013-06-15
    - introduced an additional "crunch" parameter named "relocate_output_up_to",
      allowing to relocate compressed data to the given end address (as opposite
      to the "relocate_output", which relocates data to the given start address)

0.05  2013-01-16
    - fixed "undefined symbol 'mXPUSHs'" compilation error for Perl 5.10.0 by
      removing "mXPUSHs()" macro from the XS code (according to perl5101delta
      "mXPUSHs()" macro for pushing SVs on the stack and mortalizing them has
      been introduced in Perl 5.10.1)

0.04  2013-01-13
    - fixed "error: two or more data types in declaration specifiers"
      compilation error on FreeBSD by reordering include directives in
      "cruncher.h" and "file.h" header files, and thus making sure that "bb.h"
      is always processed after "sys/types.h" header file (included by
      "sys/stat.h"), which on FreeBSD redefines a "uint" type without checking
      if the same type definition has already existed before

0.03  2013-01-08
    - fixed "error: expected identifier before numeric constant" compilation
      error by replacing all occurrences of "true" and "false" constants with
      "_true" and "_false" labels in the original source code right before
      packaging the actual release of this module, so that it now successfully
      compiles also Mac OS X (which, it turned out, has got those constants
      already predefined)

0.02  2013-01-05
    - updated "ByteBoozer" source code to version 1.1, which was published by
      David Malmborg on June the 14th, 2012
    - fixed "error: expected ';', identifier or '(' before 'char'" compilation
      error by replacing all occurrences of a newly defined "bool" type (first
      defined in "bb.h") with "_bool" label in the original source code right
      before packaging the actual release of this module, so that it now
      successfully compiles also on most non-Linux systems as well as for
      bleadperl

0.01  2012-04-07
    - initial version (provides Perl interface to David Malmborg's ByteBoozer,
      supports crunching Commodore data files using the compression algorithm
      implemented via ByteBoozer)
